# Mushroom-Classification

## Abstract

This study focuses on the classification of mushrooms into two categories, namely Poisonous and Edible, using a machine learning model. It aims to determine the significant features that play a crucial role in predicting the edibility or toxicity of mushrooms. Mushrooms have been consumed since ancient times and are highly regarded for their nutritional value. They are low in calories, carbohydrates, fats, and sodium, while being cholesterol-free. Mushrooms offer essential nutrients such as selenium, potassium, riboflavin, niacin, Vitamin D, proteins, and fiber. They have a rich history as a food source and are also recognized for their healing properties in traditional medicine. Various health benefits and potential disease treatments have been associated with mushrooms, including their anticancer and antitumor properties. Moreover, mushrooms exhibit antibacterial effects, enhance the immune system, and assist in lowering cholesterol levels. Furthermore, mushrooms are a valuable source of bioactive compounds. Throughout this machine learning analysis, we will identify the key features that determine whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible.
